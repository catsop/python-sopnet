# We consider the following undirected graph:
#
#   ---1---
#  /  / \  \
# 0  /   \  4
#  \ |   | /
#   -2---3-
#
# We set the edge weights such that the MST without multi-factors is
#
#   ---1---
#  /  / \  \
# 0  /   \  4  (all visible edges have costs -1)
#    |   |
#    2   3
#
# and add a multi-factor that says that
#
#      1
#     / \
#    /   \     (multi-factor has costs 10, see small_graph_factors.dat)
#    |   |
#    2   3
#
# does not look like a branch. The optimal solution with the multi-factor
# should be
#
#   ---1---
#  /    \  \
# 0      \  4  (edge (2,3) has costs 0, all remaining cost 1)
#        |
#    2---3
#
# The optimal value is -3.
